# a summary about you
summary: 'We are a research group based in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University. We focus on the research, design, and evaluation of networked, energy-efficient, and secure sensing systems found in the Internet of Things (IoT) and its AI-empowered generation (AIoT). Our research has two main sub-directions of **IoT sensing systems/applications** and **security/privacy of AIoT sensing**. In the first sub-direction, with a strong experimental focus, we study a number of sensing modalities (e.g., powerline radiation, radio frequency, acoustics, image, thermal, and energy), exploit them to construct system functions and applications. In the second sub-direction, we study the security and privacy of AIoT sensing systems that use machine learning to process the sensed data. Due to the immediate application potential, our research has been funded externally by government authorities and companies in the ICT, energy, and manufacturing sectors.'
