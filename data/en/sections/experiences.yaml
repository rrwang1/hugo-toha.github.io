    responsibilities:
    - The periodic electric and magnetic fields emitted by the service power cables distributed in civil infrastructures provide both time and location information. Our research exploits these fields to develop clock synchronization, natural timestamping, localization, and device authentication services for indoor and wearable IoT objects.

  - designation: LoRa radio sensing
    start: 1
    end: 1
    responsibilities:
    - LoRa is a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology that can interconnect IoT objects distributed in large geographic areas or deep indoor/underground structures. Its long-range communication capability enables wide-area sensing using its own radio frequency signals. We sense the arrival time, frequency bias, and strength of LoRa signal for data timestamping, network security, and object localization.
