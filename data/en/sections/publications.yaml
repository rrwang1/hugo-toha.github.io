  paper:
    summary: Domain shift can greatly degrade the performance of deep model. We exploit the first principle governing the domain shift to augment data for retraining the model. In the case studies of speech recognition, with 5-second unlabelled data collected from the target-domain microphones, we can recover the accuracy losses due to microphone characteristic variations by up to 72%.

  paper:
    summary: Naturally occurring disturbances and malicious attacks can lead to faults in synchronizing the clocks of two network nodes. In this work, we investigate the fundamental resilience bounds of network clock synchronization for a system of N nodes against the peer-to-peer synchronization faults. The analysis in the work provides basic understanding and useful guidelines to the design of resilient clock synchronization systems.

  paper:
    summary: Maintaining tight clock synchronization of LoRaWAN end devices for data timestamping is costly due to limited bandwidth. We show that timestamping based on uplink frame arrival time at the gateway is efficient but can be insecure. We design a gateway added with the RTL-SDR to analyze the bias of the uplink carrier frequency to improve the security of gateway-side data timestamping.

- title: Moving Target Defense for Embedded Deep Visual Sensing against Adversarial Examples

  paper:
    summary: Deep learning-based visual sensing is vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are slightly perturbed inputs to mislead classification models. We follow the moving target defense method to generate multiple new deep models after system deployment, that will collaboratively detect and thwart adversarial examples. It significantly increases the bar of successful attacks. We also apply serial data fusion with early stopping to reduce the inference time.

  paper:
    summary: We design a device authentication system in which the user wearing a token device can be granted access to touchable IoT objects in indoor environments. Our design exploits the complex time-periodic electric field generated by the powerlines distributed in the indoor space and the coupling between the field and the human body.
